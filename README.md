This is a new program which I have made over the time of two days. It is still a work in progress but is a working fast food POS system.
I will have future builds of this upcoming. Editing Items is going to be a big deal for anyone wanting to personalise the application.
I am currently working with AI to receive a solid build of this McDonalds-like style POS system.

It involves drinks display/food display screens as well as a core POS system to input order into the system.

CLICK THE MAIN LAUNCHER.PY to start the program and ensure all files are kept in the POS folder.
